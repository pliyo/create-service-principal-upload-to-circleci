# Creates Service Principal for AKS

The aim of this project is to retrieve the information from the Service Principal once created, so it could be reused somewhere else.
For example, to store the `appId`, `displayName`, `name`, `pass` or `tenant` somewhere else after creation. 

You can read about how to do that from here:
